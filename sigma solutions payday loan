istory books will remember 2020 as a challenging year for the U.S. as it grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic and a contentious political landscape. Unemployment rates have skyrocketed and millions of those who remain employed still struggle to make ends meet. And, unfortunately, that was the case even before the pandemic.

Seventy-eight percent of workers in the U.S. live paycheck to paycheck, according to Earnin, a financial app that aims to help workers gain more financial security. Low-wage workers are often forced to turn to less than ideal means to meet their financial needs, such as payday loans that often come with crushing interest rates. Payday loans can sometimes help workers in the short-term, but it sends many of them into an even worse cycle of debt than they were in before.
